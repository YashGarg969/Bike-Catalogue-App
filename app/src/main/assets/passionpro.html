    <h3>About Passion Pro</h3>
    <p>Hero Passion Pro is a commuter bike available at a starting price of Rs. 69,401 in India. It is available in 4 variants and 6 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 73,742. The Hero Passion Pro is powered by 110cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 9.02 bhp and a torque of 9.89 Nm. With both front and rear drum brakes, Hero Passion Pro comes up with combined braking system of both wheels. This Passion Pro bike weighs 117 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 10 liters.

The Passion Pro is one of the highest selling Hero motorcycles. It is based on the same platform as its highly-popular model, the Splendor iSmart 110 but gets modern and youthful styling. Along with a new BS6 engine it is also now equipped with lots of features.

In terms of styling, the new Passion Pro 110 looks considerably sportier than the previous model, thanks to a larger and more angular headlamp surrounded by a new bikini fairing. It also gets a sportier mid-section with the presence of fuel tank extensions adorned with prominent ‘PRO’ decals. At the rear, the under seat panels and tail lamp also boast of a sharper design now.

While the displacement of the new Passion Pro remains the same at 110cc, there's a slight drop in power but a marginal hike in torque, both of which now stand at 9.02bhp and 9.79Nm. As claimed by the company, the reworked engine delivers better mileage. Meanwhile, the gearbox is four speed.</p>
