<h3>About Jawa Perak</h3>
<p>Jawa Perak is a cruiser bike available at a starting price of Rs. 2,08,297 in India. It is available in only 1 variant and 1 colour. The Jawa Perak is powered by 334cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 30 bhp and a torque of 32.74 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Jawa Perak comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Perak bike weighs 175 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 14 liters.

    The Perak is a historic brand for Jawa, and the name has been resurrected by the company for a factory-custom bobber. The motorcycle was showcased for the first time during the launch of the brand and after a year it has been now officially launched in the country.

    Being a factory-custom styled bobber, the Perak is one gorgeous looking motorcycle. It features a typical low-slung profile with a longer wheelbase as compared to the other Jawa models. It follows a blacked-out theme with a matte black-grey paint job and a black coloured theme for most of its mechanical parts. The design is accentuated with gold pinstriping on the fuel tank, side panels and fenders. The other biggest highlight of the motorcycle is the floating seat design with a tan-brown leather seat that gives the Perak the classic bobber stance.

    In terms of equipment, the Perak comes with conventional halogen lamp all around except for the tail lamp which is LED. The instrument cluster is a circular unit with a small digital unit for the odometer which has been lifted from the Jawa Standard. The motorcycle rides on telescopic forks up front and a monoshock mount below the seat for the rear. Braking is done by disc brakes at both ends, fortified by dual-channel ABS.

    As for the powertrain, the Perak gets a slightly larger 334cc engine compared to the Jawa Standard and Forty-Two. It continues to be a single-cylinder unit with liquid-cooling and is capable of churning out 30bhp and 31Nm in terms of power output figures. Transmission duties are handled by a six-speed gearbox.

    For its price and styling, the Jawa Perak competes against the likes of the Royal Enfield Classic 500 in the market.</p>
