    <h3>About AVENGER</h3>
    <p>The Bajaj Avenger is a brand of cruiser bikes made by Bajaj Auto in India. There are 3 Avenger models on offer with price starting from Rs. 95,459 (ex-showroom). The cheapest model under the series is Bajaj Avenger Street 160 with 160cc engine generating 14.6 bhp of power, whereas the most expensive model is Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220 with 220cc engine generating 18.4 bhp of power.< br>
The Eliminator was the first cruiser that Bajaj put out in conjunction with Kawasaki, but after their split in the Indian market, the cruiser was renamed the Avenger. It started off sharing the Pulsar’s 150cc engine, and that trend continued – at different points of time it has had 150cc, 180cc, 200cc and 220cc engines. The trend continues, with the current range sporting the Pulsar’s 180cc and 220cc engines. The Avenger can be had with the Street, with its urban styling, in either engine, or in the touring-focused Cruise 220, with its more retro looks. The Street gets snazzy graphics, a black-based paint scheme and alloy wheels, while the Cruise get loads of chrome, a white paint scheme, spoked rims and a windshield.</p>
