<h3>About Panigale V2</h3>
<p>Ducati Panigale V2 is a super bike available at a starting price of Rs. 17,48,826 in India. It is available in only 1 variant and 2 colours. The Ducati Panigale V2 is powered by 955cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 152.8 bhp and a torque of 104 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Ducati Panigale V2 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Panigale V2 bike weighs 200 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 17 liters.

    The new Ducati Panigale V2 is the successor to the Panigale 959 in the middleweight superbike segment. The latest iteration of the motorcycle, similar to its predecessor, draws styling cues from the flagship Panigale V4 model. Thus, styling cues on the new Panigale V2 include a twin-pod headlight, full-fairing design, split-style seats and single-sided swingarm. The motorcycle uses a die-cast aluminium monocoque frame that uses the engine as a stressed member.

    The feature list on the Ducati Panigale V2 includes LED headlights with LED DRLs at the front, an LED taillight and a Bluetooth-enabled 4.3-inch colour TFT display. The Ducati Multimedia System offers access to incoming calls, selection of music and display of text messages.

    The new Panigale V2 comes equipped with a BS6-compliant 955cc, 90-degree, V-twin cylinder, liquid-cooled engine that delivers a healthy 152.8bhp of peak power at 10,750rpm and 104Nm of maximum torque at 9,000rpm. The six-speed gearbox benefits from the Ducati Quick Shift bi-directional quick-shifter system. Other electronic aids include traction control, cornering ABS, engine brake control, wheelie control and three riding modes (Race, Sports and Road).

    The shock absorption tasks are handled by 43 mm Showa Big Piston Fork at the front and a Sachs mono-shock at the rear – both fully adjustable. Stopping power comes from twin, 320mm discs at the front with M4.32 Brembo monobloc callipers and a single 245mm disc at the rear with a single Brembo calliper.

    The new Ducati Panigale V2 has been priced at Rs 16.99 lakh (ex-showroom) which makes it Rs 2.25 lakh more expensive than the previous 959 model.</p>
