    <h3>About Hayabusa</h3>
    <p>Suzuki Hayabusa is a super bike available at a starting price of Rs. 16,43,695 in India. It is available in only 1 variant and 3 colours. The Suzuki Hayabusa is powered by 1340cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 187.3 bhp and a torque of 150 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Suzuki Hayabusa comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Hayabusa bike weighs 266 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 20 liters.

        The new Hayabusa receives massive upgrades for 2021 compared to earlier generations. In terms of styling, Suzuki has also cleverly retained the design silhouette of the previous generation Hayabusas while offering the new-gen model a more aggressive appeal. It also gets full-LED lighting for the headlamp, turn signals, and the tail lamp that lend it a fresher appeal.
        
        Now, the handling on the 2021 ‘Busa has also been tweaked with a revised frame that not only reduces weight but also boasts of 50:50 weight distribution. And underneath this frame the Suzuki Hayabusa uses a slightly retuned version of the tried and test 1340cc inline-four motor. With the new tune, the engine is capable of producing 188bhp at 9,700rpm compared to the earlier 194bhp. And while the torque has dropped to 150Nm, from 155Nm, it comes in earlier at 7,000rpm. The motor now benefits from a two-way quickshifter fitted as standard.
        
        And finally, Suzuki has equipped the Hayabusa with an exhaustive list of electronic aids that include five riding modes, a six-axis IMU, ride-by-wire, ABS, traction control, anti-lift control system, active speed limiter, launch control and engine brake control. That’s not all, the 2021 Hayabusa also gets low RPM assist, cruise control as well as hill and slope control. As cherry on the cake, the new Hayabusa is also fitted with a TFT screen between the analogue tachometer and speedometer.</p>
