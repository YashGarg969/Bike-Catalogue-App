<h3>About 125 Duke</h3>
<p>KTM 125 Duke is a street bike available at a starting price of Rs. 1,70,434 in India. It is available in only 1 variant and 1 colour. The KTM 125 Duke is powered by 124.71cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 14.3 bhp and a torque of 12 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, KTM 125 Duke comes up with anti-locking braking system. This 125 Duke bike weighs 159 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 13.5 liters.

    The 125 Duke is the baby of the Duke lineup. It exists because of the licensing laws in markets like the European Union, which allow 125cc motorcycles to be ridden with a car driver’s licence.

    It shares everything with its bigger siblings, which means great cycle parts. They include a trellis frame, upside-down front forks, a radially mounted front brake calliper with four opposed pistons, a six-speed gearbox, and an all-digital instrument cluster that shows a lot of information. The 125 Duke also gets a single-channel ABS system, which makes the first product in the country under 125cc to offer an ABS system instead of a linked braking system.

    Mechanical specifications include a BS6-compliant, 199cc, single-cylinder engine that produces 14.3bhp and 12Nm of torque; same as the BS4 model. Apart from this, the motorcycle gets the same styling as the current-gen 200 Duke.

    KTM is offering the 125 Duke in a choice of two dual-tone colours - white and black along with orange and white. In terms of competition, the KTM 125 Duke competes against the MT-15 in the country.</p>
