<h3>About Panigale V4</h3>
<p>Ducati Panigale V4 is a super bike available at a starting price of Rs. 23,50,000 in India. It is available in 3 variants and 3 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 36,07,000. The Ducati Panigale V4 is powered by 1103cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 211.21 bhp and a torque of 124 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Ducati Panigale V4 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Panigale V4 bike weighs 198 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 16 liters.

    The BS6-compliant Ducati Panigale V4 and the Panigale V4 S entered the Indian market in June 2021. The two models get a similar design and specifications, although the premium S variant benefits from an electronically-adjustable suspension while the standard model uses a manually-adjustable setup.

    The mechanical specifications on the Panigale V4 range comprise of a BS6-compliant 1,103cc, Desmosedici Stradale 90-degree V4, liquid-cooled engine. Linked to a six-speed gearbox, the motor makes 211bhp of power at 13,000rpm and 124Nm of peak torque at 9,500rpm. The gearbox benefits from a bidirectional quickshifter. The exhaust on the BS6 model uses larger catalysts (+10mm in length) and packs a new technology of impregnation of noble metals. This is aimed at eliminating any loss of power during the BS6 transition.

    In terms of design, the BS6-compliant Panigale V4 range looks similar to its predecessor. The new model, however, benefits from an aerodynamic package that is claimed to deliver 30kg of downforce at 270kmph. The 2021 model also benefits from a chain guard fin, a provision for heated grips, a new grip for the ignition key, and new self-bleeding brake and clutch pumps that were first used on the Superleggera V4.

    The suspension setup on the S variant comprises electronically-adjustable Ohlins shock absorbers while the standard model uses manually-adjustable Showa front forks and Sachs rear mono-shock. The braking hardware is similar on both variants and the anchoring power comes from twin 330mm discs with Brembo Monobloc Stylema (M4.30) four-piston callipers at the front and a single 245mm rotor with two-piston callipers at the front.

    Standard features on the Panigale V4 and the Panigale V4 S include LED headlights, a five-inch fully-digital colour display, a six-axis IMU, Bosch cornering ABS, wheelie control, traction control system, launch control, slide control, and engine brake control. The 2021 Panigale V4 range also gets Race Riding Mode that comprises two mappings (Race A and Race B). The new mode joins the existing Sport and Street modes.</p>
