    <h3>About Splendor Plus</h3>
    <p>Hero Splendor Plus is a mileage bike available at a starting price of Rs. 63,497 in India. It is available in 5 variants and 8 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 69,181. The Hero Splendor Plus is powered by 97.2cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 7.91 bhp and a torque of 8.05 Nm. With both front and rear drum brakes, Hero Splendor Plus comes up with combined braking system of both wheels. This Splendor Plus bike weighs 110 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 9.8 liters.

        The Splendor Plus continues to be Hero Motocorp’s best-selling product. The motorcycle comes in three variants including kick-start with alloy wheels, self-start with alloy wheels and self-start with alloys and i3S.
        
        The 100cc, carbureted motor of the Splendor Plus has now been updated with a fuel-injection set up with Hero’s ‘XSens technology.’ The engine now produces 7.91bhp at 8,000rpm and 8.05Nm at 6,000rpm. This is a drop of 1.3bhp with the torque figure remaining intact but arriving 1000rpm later. The engine continues to be mated with a four-speed gearbox.
        
        While the motorcycle has remained unchanged in terms of styling, Hero did introduce the new Black and Accent variant and the 100 Million Edition to keep the market excited. Here, the wheels, engine and chain cover have been dipped in black. The cycle parts have also been retained with telescopic forks and dual shock absorbers and drum brakes at both ends. While the BS4 Splendor Plus weighs 109kg (kerb), the BS6 model is slightly heavy due to the changes on the engine. The fuel tank capacity stands at 11 litres.
        
        Considering its displacement and purpose, the Hero Splendor Plus BS6 faces competition from the TVS Sport.</p>
