<h3>About RC 390</h3>
<p>KTM RC 390 is a sports bike available at a starting price of Rs. 2,77,501 in India. It is available in only 1 variant and 2 colours. The KTM RC 390 is powered by 373cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 42.9 bhp and a torque of 35 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, KTM RC 390 comes up with anti-locking braking system.

    The KTM RC 390 BS6 gets a cosmetic update as part of the 2020 update. While it retains the aggressive design and bodywork of the previous model which incorporates the distinctive LED-projector headlamps upfront, the RC 390 is now adorned in a new colour scheme.

    The fully-faired motorcycle is available in two colours - Black with white and Metallic Silver. While the streetfighter 390 Duke is updated with a bi-directional quick shifter, the new RC 390 misses out on that feature. Besides prepping it up for the BS6 norms, KTM has retained the power output from the 373cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine. It continues to put out 43bhp of power and 37Nm of torque. Suspension and braking hardware also remain the same as the previous model.

    In terms of competition, the KTM RC390 goes up against the TVS Apache RR 310, Yamaha R3 and Kawasaki Ninja 400.</p>
