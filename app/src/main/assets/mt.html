    <h3>About MT15</h3>
    <p>Yamaha MT 15 is a street bike available at a starting price of Rs. 1,47,657 in India. It is available in 3 variants and 4 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 1,50,759. The Yamaha MT 15 is powered by 155cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 18.23 bhp and a torque of 13.9 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Yamaha MT 15 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This MT 15 bike weighs 138 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 10 liters.

The MT-15 is a naked streetbike from Yamaha that is based on the company’s MT series. The MT-15 shares most of its underpinnings with its fully-faired sibling, the YZF R15 V3.0. It features a transformer-style front fairing with an LED projector headlamp, sculpted tank with tank extensions, a wide handlebar and a petite tail section.
Yamaha has launched the new Monster Energy MotoGP edition of the MT 15 in the Indian market. This edition carries a premium of about Rs Rs 2,000 over the already available special-edition trim of the bike. The changes to the Yamaha MT15 Monster Energy Edition are only limited to cosmetic upgrades. The motorcycle features subtle MotoGP cosmetic treatment that includes a black paint scheme along with Monster Energy branding on the fuel tank and logo on tank extensions. The motorcycle also gets a BS6-compliant version of the 155cc, single-cylinder engine that produces 18.2bhp of power at 10,000rpm; 0.2bhp lesser than the 2020 YZF-R15 V3 which also uses the same motor. Furthermore, it also gets a side-stand engine inhibitor. 
In terms of competition, the Yamaha Mt-15 goes up against the KTM 125 Duke in India. </p>
