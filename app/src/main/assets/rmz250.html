    <h3>About Suzuki RM-Z250</h3>
    <p>The Suzuki RM-Z250 is a purpose-built, dedicated motocross machine which claims to incorporate a variety of features originally created for Suzuki’s factory race machine. Powered by a four-stroke, single-cylinder, 249 cc, double overhead cam (DOHC) engine, the RM-Z250 offers a lightweight, and compact motocross bike with an engine which is said to offer very good mid-range power and torque, with smooth and linear power delivery. The Suzuki RM-Z250 is for off-road and motocross competition use only, and so is not road legal, and cannot be registered for normal street use. The
        RM-Z250 takes features and performance upgrades directly from the Suzuki MX2 and MXGP World Championship factory machines.
        
        The RM-Z250 features the Suzuki Holeshot Assist Control (S-HAC), a selectable launch mode system derived straight from factory race bikes. The S-HAC helps riders from launching from starting gate for an early lead, and comes in two selectable modes, enabling riders to choose the best option for conditions and their skill level. The S-HAC has a new, three-stage version on the RM-Z250, which adjusts the ignition map for the initial launch moment, and then re-adjusts the timing when the motorcycle moves through the starting gate area, then another adjustment is applied during the
        longer primary acceleration period. Needless to say, the S-HAC is a motocross and race-specific feature and will only be helpful to competition racers.
        
        To withstand rugged terrain during supercross and motocross events, as well as normal off-road conditions, the Suzuki RM-Z250 comes with black anodized Excel aluminium rims which are lightweight yet strong enough to withstand severe conditions. The front suspension is a new design KYB PSF2 Pneumatic Spring fork, which uses air chambers in place of steel springs for light weight, easy adjustability and improved damper performance. Compression damping is adjustable while rebound damping force is both high- and low-speed adjustable. Rear suspension is also from KYB, and the nitrogen-charged, piggyback style monoshock features a new top-mounted integral adjuster system for easy adjustment of the high- and low-speed rebound, and high- and low-speed compression damping force adjusters. On the engine, race-spec cams, a factory-developed piston and high compression intake valves increase intake efficiency.
        
        Upcoming Suzuki Models are the V-Strom 1050 and SV 650</p>
