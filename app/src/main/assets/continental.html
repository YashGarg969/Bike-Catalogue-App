    <h3>About CONTINENTAL GT 650</h3>
    <p>Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 is a cafe racer bike available at a starting price of Rs. 2,97,003 in India. It is available in 3 variants and 5 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 3,19,132. The Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 is powered by 648cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 47 bhp and a torque of 52 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Continental GT 650 bike weighs 198 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 12.5 liters.

The Continental GT 650 is the sportier of the two models based on the 650cc twin cylinder platform from Royal Enfield. It follows the café racer format, and eschews the pillion seat for a better experience for the focused rider.

The Continental GT has at its heart a BS6-compliant, fuel-injected 648cc parallel twin air/oil cooled motor that generates 46.8bhp and 52Nm. It feeds the rear wheel via a six-speed gearbox and chain drive. The chassis, brakes and suspension are all modern-feeling, with all the charm that their retro looks offer. The brakes are single discs at both ends, with a 320mm disc at the front, and a 240mm disc at the rear.The motorcycle competes on price with the KTM 390 Duke, although in spec it is a lot closer to the Kawasaki Z650. </p>
