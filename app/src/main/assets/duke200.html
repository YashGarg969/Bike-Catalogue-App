<h3>About Duke 200</h3>
<p>KTM 200 Duke is a street bike available at a starting price of Rs. 1,85,564 in India. It is available in only 1 variant and 2 colours. The KTM 200 Duke is powered by 199.5cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 25.4 bhp and a torque of 19.5 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, KTM 200 Duke comes up with anti-locking braking system. This 200 Duke bike weighs 159 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 13.5 liters.

    KTM has heavily updated the 200 Duke’s styling giving it a completely new design as compared to the previous model which was introduced in 2012. It gets a angular headlamp with the LED DRL, an aggressively styled fuel tank which now has a 13.5 litre capacity (10.2-litres on the earlier model) along with a sleek tail section with a split-seat setup.

    Moreover, the new KTM 200 Duke comes in two colour options with refreshed graphics. It is available in an orange and black paint scheme called Electric Orange and a white with black paint scheme named Ceramic White.

    Apart from this, the other change is to the motorcycle’s 199cc, single-cylinder, fuel-injected motor which is now BS6-compliant. However, it produces the same 24.6bhp and 19.3Nm of torque. As for cycle parts, KTM has retained the same suspension and braking hardware as the previous model.

    In terms of competition, the motorcycle goes up against the Bajaj Pulsar 200NS and the TVS Apache RTR 200 4V.</p>
