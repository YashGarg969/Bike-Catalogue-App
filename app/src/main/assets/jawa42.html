<h3>About Jawa 42</h3>
<p>Jawa 42 is a cruiser bike available at a starting price of Rs. 1,67,171 in India. It is available in 3 variants and 9 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 1,93,356. The Jawa 42 is powered by 293cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 27 bhp and a torque of 27.05 Nm. With front disc and rear drum brakes, Jawa 42 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This 42 bike weighs 172 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 14 liters.

    Classic Legends have extended the Jawa 42 range with the addition of the Version 2.1 in the Indian market. The new Jawa 42 Version gets several upgrades that make the motorcycle more modern than ever before.

    The biggest upgrade is the addition of alloy wheels that replace the wire-spoke setup. The new set of wheels are wrapped in tubeless tyres. The styling upgrades include a dark theme and the new Jawa 42 Version 2.1 gets a black finish to the engine, exhaust canisters, front fork covers, and the rear springs. The motorcycle also features an offset racing stripe that runs along the fuel tank and into the rear fender. Other changes to the motorcycle include a revision to the seat padding and a new design for the pillion grabrail. Classic Legends have also added a flyscreen and a headlamp grille as optional extras.

    The motorcycle retains cycle parts such as telescopic front forks, preload-adjustable twin rear springs, a 280mm disc at the front, a 240mm rotor at the rear, and dual-channel ABS. The new Jawa 42 version 2.1 will be available in three colours – Orion Red, Sirius White, and All Star Black.

    Mechanical specifications continue to feature a 293cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine that makes 27bhp and 27Nm of peak torque. The motor is linked to a six-speed gearbox. The Jawa 42 series rivals the likes of Royal Enfield Meteor 350, Honda CB350, and the Benelli Imperiale 400.</p>
