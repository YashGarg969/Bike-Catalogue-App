    <h3>About PLATINA 100</h3>
    <p>Bajaj Platina 100 is a mileage bike available at a starting price of Rs. 52,866 in India. It is available in 4 variants and 6 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 63,543. The Bajaj Platina 100 is powered by 102cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 7.9 bhp and a torque of 8.34 Nm. With both front and rear drum brakes, Bajaj Platina 100 comes up with combined braking system of both wheels. This Platina 100 bike weighs 117 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 11 liters.

The Bajaj Platina 100 is an entry-level commuter motorcycle specially developed for the rural markets. It sits above the most affordable Bajaj, the CT100 and CT110 models. This bike is available in kick Start and electric Start versions. To make it more practical, the Pune-based manufacturer has equipped the bike with knuckle guards.

The Platina 100 gets its power from a BS6-compliant 102cc fuel-injected unit which produces 7.8bhp and 8.34Nm of torque. The engine is mated to a four-speed manual gearbox with an all-down pattern. The motorcycle features a 13-litre fuel tank and it is meant to be profoundly fuel efficient. With the shift from carburetor to fuel-injection owing to the new BS6 norms, the Platina is expected to deliver marginal increase in overall fuel efficiency.

The Platina 100 gets long travel front forks and rear springs for a supple ride quality. It also gets a soft seat cushion, rubber footpads and directional tyres to further improve comfort levels. The frame, exhaust and the grab rails of the Platina are painted in black, while the engine crankcase and wheels are finished in silver. The rest of the design is pretty basic and Bajaj has maintained a very conventional look. 
The Platina competes with the Honda Dream Neo, TVS Star City Plus and Hero MotoCorp HF Deluxe. It is available in just two colours - red and black.</p>
