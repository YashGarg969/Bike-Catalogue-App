    <h3>About YZF R15 V3</h3>
    <p>The Yamaha R15 changed the 150cc segment in the Indian market the way the CBZ did when it was launched. It was an everyday motorcycle that could genuinely be used as a trackday tool. The second version of the R15 traded practicality for more focused performance, but the advent of the KTM RC200 meant that a far better performance was available for the sportbike enthusiasts at a similar price. The R15 Version 3.0 reduces that gap significantly with technology. On the list is now a BS6 engine with a few more ccs, but featuring variable valve timing which takes the maximum power output to nearly 18.3bhp with a peak torque output of 14.1Nm. It also gets all-LED lamps and an all-digital LCD instrument cluster that displays a wealth of information, including when the Variable Valve Actuation switches to the different camshaft profile. 
The R15 Version 3.0 BS6 is available in four colour shades of Racing Blue, Thunder Grey, Darknight, and Metallic Red. </p>
